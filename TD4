## Exercise 1: Clone a Git repository
#### Question 1. Choose the repository created on GitHub or GitLab by one of your teammates, share its web URL.
'''

'''
#### Question 2. For the repository owner... Ensure there is at least a README.md file, it appears on the project frontpage in the web UI.
'''

'''
#### Question 3. Using only command-line in your Linux shell, clone it to a local repository.
'''

'''
#### Question 4. For the repository owner... Give push rights to your teammates :
'''

'''

## Exercise 2: Push files to common repository
#### Question 1. Create a branch named after you.
'''
git checkout -b <your_branch_name>
'''
#### Question 2. Create a new text file named after you (with the content you want).
'''
touch <your_file_name>
'''
#### Question 3. Commit this new file.
'''
git add <your_file_name>
'''
#### Question4. Push your branch to the remote repository.
'''
git commit -m "<commit_message>"
git push -u origin <your_branch_name>
'''

## Exercise 3: Merge simple changes
#### Question 1. Merge your branch into the ’master’ branch.
'''
git checkout master
git merge <your_branch_name>
'''
#### Question 2. Push your changes in the ’master’ branch to the remote repository.
'''
git push origin master
'''

## Exercise 4: Resolve merge conflicts
#### Question 1. Switch back to your own branch (not including the latest changes from the master branch).
'''
git checkout <your_branch_name>
'''
#### Question 2. Edit the lines 2 to 6 of the README.md file with a text you like (a poem, a quote, some clever code...). It can be any readable text, it may be incomplete, it must just take about 5 lines and be different from your teammates. It must start on line 2 to trigger conflicts between team members.
'''
nano README.md
'''
#### Question 3. Commit this change.
'''
git add README.md
'''
#### Question 4. Pull latest status from the remote repository ’master’ branch into your local ’master’ branch.
'''
git commit -m "<commit_message>"
'''
#### Question 5. Merge your branch into the local ’master’ branch.
'''
git checkout master
'''
#### Question 6. If there are conflicts, we want the paragraph to appear in alphabetical order in the final README.md file.
'''
git pull origin master
'''
#### Question 7. Push your changes in the ’master’ branch to the remote repository.
'''
git merge
'''
